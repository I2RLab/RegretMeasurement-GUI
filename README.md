# RegretMeasurement-GUI
This is a survey instrument coded in Matlab for quantitative measure of regret theory. 
Regret theory is a model for human-like decision-making which can describe the risk-seeking and risk-averse behaviors. 
The explanation of the HCI design is published in IFAC conference on Cyber Physical and Human System 2018. The eprint is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00462.  

The Graphic User Interface (GUI) of the survey instrument is written in Matlab R2016a. It is better to be run with this or higher version of Matlab. It may still work for lower version, but the author did not test it, so use with caution. 

The GUI is programmed with a screen resolution 1600x900. Using screen with other resolutions may result in slightly distorted display. These distortion can be adjusted by editing the related .fig files with GUIDE application in Matlab.
