# RegretMeasurement-GUI
This is a survey instrument coded in Matlab for quantitative measure of regret theory. Regret theory is a model for human-like decision-making which can describe the risk-seeking and risk-averse behaviors. The explanation of the HCI design is published in IFAC conference on Cyber Physical and Human System 2018. The preprint is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00462.  

# Requirements
To run this code, Matlab R2016a or higher is required. The code is tested in Windows and Linux environment. Runing on MAC OS should be okay. 

# Instruction
To run this code, you should download all the files to the same folder. Run "Main.m" to start the GUI. 

# Data
The output data are stored in "{current folder}/ParticipantsRegretData/" in ".mat" format. To make sense of the data, some data analysis tool is required. These tools are in the repository named "RegretDataAnalysis" in this account. Go there to find more information.
