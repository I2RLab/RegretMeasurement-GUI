# RegretMeasurement-GUI
This is a survey instrument coded in Matlab for quantitative measure of regret theory. Regret theory is a model for human-like decision-making which can describe the risk-seeking and risk-averse behaviors. The explanation of the HCI design is published in IFAC conference on Cyber Physical and Human System 2018. The preprint is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00462.
